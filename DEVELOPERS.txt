Common bugs, symptoms and causes:

Application crashes. (You recently edited the translations)
- You miss a comma, or have an extra comma somewhere.
  The JSON files don't tolerate trailing commas. Last property cannot end with comma, the others have to.

You don't see data on the UI, that should be there
- You are not subscribed to it. Check the mongo db, if its there, then this is the case.
  Check what subscriptions are active in Mongol.
- Possible that you are subscribed, but the subscription doesn't publish the fields you are looking for.
  Check the subscription's code.

Exception while trying to find an element by id
- You are using Collection.find(_id) instead of Collection.findOne(_id)
  find() returns a Cursor, that can be fetch()-ed, findOne() returns an actual Document.

Translation of autoform fields doesn't show for you language
- You have accidentally overridden the translation, eg had "topic" as object, so "topic.text.label" was a translated field,
  but then you put in a translation for "topic". This replaces the whole "topic" object, so those translations are lost.
- You have "collection.field.label" translated in your language, but not in english.
  The field path has to be translated into english (even if thats just the same as key) for autoform-i18n to work.
